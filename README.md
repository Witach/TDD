<h3>TDD technique is splited into 3 steps.</h3>
<ol>
<li>RED - Firstly you have to write tests Which you need later to check your added functionality.</li>
<li>GREEN - In this step you have to fastly wrtie functionality for which you've written tests before.</li>
<li>REFACTOR - When your funcionality favorably  passed  tests you should change the code to make it more readable and clean.</li>
